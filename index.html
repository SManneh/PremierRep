<h1>Sainabou's Intro</h1>
<h2>A brief intro about myself</h2>
<p>Hey guys! My name is Sainabou Manneh. 
  I have zero experience in coding. I did however create a blog on wordpress :).. 
  that counts right!</p>
<p> I am very excited about this opportunity and I hope to become a master coder by
  the end of this program </p>
<p>I currently live in Dallas Texas, but I hail from The Smiling Coast of Africa, The Gambia.
